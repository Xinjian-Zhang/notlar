Scenario:

You are part of a workforce management team responsible for ensuring adequate staffing during business hours.

Your colleague is going on a long vacation, and you are assigned to substitute them.

A critical task you need to cover is the weekly shift release, where new shifts are released once a week.

Key Information:

Shifts are released every Wednesday at 16:00 for about 500 employees.

There might be issues with missing or incorrect data. It's recommended to check the data the day before or on the same day around 12:00.

Shift picking rules should be noted, and shift picking should be closed at 15:00 for uploading the shifts.

You need to perform a database query for shifts for the next week and two weeks ahead, using data based on the previous three weeks.
The information from the database should be uploaded to the workforce management tool Nice IEX.

Announce shift picking rules at 15:45 and open shift picking at 16:00.

Task:

Write an SOP using the provided information, following either the given guidelines or the ISO 9000 SOP structure template.

Identify what information might be missing or would be beneficial to have.

Approach for SOP Writing:

Define the Purpose and Scope: Outline the aim of the SOP and the processes it covers.

Identify the Audience: Consider who will use this SOP and their level of knowledge.

Create a Document Structure: Include sections like Title, Objective, Scope, Responsibilities, Procedures/Steps, References, Revision History.

Ensure Clarity and Consistency: Use clear, concise language and standardized formats.

Reproducibility: Design the SOP to be systematic and repeatable, minimizing errors.

Additional Information Needed:

Detailed shift picking rules and procedures.
Specific instructions for handling missing or incorrect data.

Backup plans for any technical issues with the database or the Nice IEX tool.

Contact information for support in case of emergencies or unexpected situations.

Guidelines for documenting any deviations from the standard process.

This SOP will serve as a detailed guide for managing the weekly shift release, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the absence of your colleague.
