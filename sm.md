## Assignment #3 - State charts & Application Class model

----

### **Task #1 (1 point):** 
    
Please provide an updated description of the system you are modelling. Make sure that it matches the designed model as closely as possible and that all details (previously - classes, their attributes, relationships between classes, actors, use-cases, sequence of operations etc., now - states, operations etc.) are specified in both the model and the description.

Expected length – ½ - 1 A4 page.

----

### **Task #2 (4 points):** 

Provide state chart for the system you described in Task #1. Make sure you use composite states (where relevant) at least once.

Note that the model should consist of at least at least 4 states, 7 events, guards, at least three types of actions/operations, composite states (at least once, where relevant), history pseudo-states (at least once, where relevant)

----

### **Task #3 (3 points):**

Provide application class model for the system you described in Task#1.  


Add at least one sentence describing how does it differ from the model you developed as part of assignment#1 Task#1.  

----

### **Task #4 (1.5 point):** 

What is the environment, which you choose to design your statechart and application class model? What were the decisive factors to give the preference to this environment(s)?

**(1 point out of 1.5):** Does it allow you to generate the code from the designed model? If yes, what are your observations regarding the generated code? Have you identified any weakness in it? Does the code match the designed model? If not, were the expectations-reality differences due to deficiencies in the original model that you were forced to correct?

----

### **Task #5 (0.5 point):**

Provide evidence that the work was conducted in a team (e.g., in the form of a link to the VCS; the screenshot of the above etc.).

----

### **Task #6 (optional):** 

Explore and document ChatGPT or other LLM capabilities in modelling statecharts and application class models (in addition to Task#2 and #3, but not instead!). Was it possible to achieve the same result that you obtained in Task #2 and #3? If not, what were the differences? What are strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT in addressing this task? Had the use of ChatGPT allowed you to improve either the description (Task#1) or the model (Task#2, #3)?
