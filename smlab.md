23.11

In coming 2 weeks lectures will be delivered by TA Ahmed Mahmoud. They will take place ONLINE.

As you just submitted your Homework and are already given assignment#3, where one of the main topic is statecharts, instead of usual practical session this week, you will have a "self-study" session, where I invite you to have a training with Yakindu StateCharts Tool specifying a controller for a light bulb, following a step-by-step guide. It will learn how to model, simulate and execute statecharts using Yakindu. Although this task will not be graded, I invite you to spend the time of practical session walking through this guide, after which refer to assignment#3 and preparing a statechart for your system. 

The date of exam is coming closer, hence comes more information on it. First of all, please keep in mind that exam is a mandatory component of this course.

Second, as we agreed on before during one of the lectures, the exam will be an oral exam, where you will be asked several questions concerning the content of the course. The list of questions you will be asked is made known in advance and you can find it here. Please, keep in mind that when answering a question, the scope of the question may be expanded, i.e., you may be asked a question related to the main question you were assigned, but not listed here. All of them, however, will cover the material that was discussed during the course.

After you will be given questions, you will be also given 7-10 minutes to prepare your answer. While preparing your answer, you can use external materials (your notes, laptop, Internet) but no consultations with external parties – your colleagues or similar.

There are two exam sessions - 12.12.2023 and 16.01.2024, where you are expected to select one date, when you come to exam. Considering that it is an oral exam, where I will have discussions with each of you, it means that the exam itself will be long. In other words, three time slots per date are available (14:00-15:30, 15:45-17:15, 17:20-18:50) and you are expected to select times and date that suits you most here, so that you attend only one session. It is also acceptable that you do not register and come, however, please, bear in mind that first those who registered will be “served” and you might wait either the end of the “queue” or finish up with no free time slot that day. At the same time, as the number of time slots is limited, your preferences indicated in the form you are invited to fill will be taken into account, however, I cannot guarantee that they all will be satisfied. Hence, you will get further information on what of those times you are expected to come later – email from me will come once the “group” (time slot) is filled (FIFO principle will be taken into account here)

The next lecture will be delivered by TA Ahmed Mahmoud, and it will take place ONLINE.
Please find link to 5.12.2023. lecture as follows - https://ut-ee.zoom.us/j/98245141899?pwd=Ulh4NXBVeVluYzIzLzZmbHMyVGxodz09
During/instead of the practical session, you are expected to

(1) IF you have not finished this last week - continue a training with Yakindu StateCharts Tool specifying a controller for a light bulb, following a step-by-step guide,

(2) familiarize yourself with Design Patterns concept - elements of re-usable OO software, for which I invite you to refer to the following condensed material  on so-called Gangs of Four (GoF) Design Patterns - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gangs-of-four-gof-design-patterns. For those who are interested in this topic, perhaps the most detailed reading from "classics" can be found here - https://github.com/nilgadia/books/blob/master/Design%20Patterns%2C%20Elements%20of%20Reusable%20Object-Oriented%20Software.pdf (Beck, K., 1995. Design patterns: Elements of reusable object-oriented software. IBM Systems Journal, 34(3))- in fact, this is relatively difficult to find book since it is predominantly available for buying it, so you can use an opportunity to take a look at it or better read it (at least in the future) for free,

(3) IF you would like to have a conversation on your assignment#3 with me, join me in Zoom @17:05 (several groups can also be "served" @14:00 - before the lecture, but for this, please do let me know via DM) via Zoom link we used before for lectures, namely -> https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ut-ee.zoom.us/j/96107392606?pwd%3DNURPTjJnajhvSysvNzljVTNMTXpxQT09&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw3XupKyOQNuvDeo7QQjBfxx

Hopefully this more relaxed week will give you some time to be devoted to assignment#3, which is due 10.12. For those, who would like to take exam 12.12, this time is expected to be used for getting prepared for it
